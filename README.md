## Overview
Super simple worked example of using a packml station.  This has a single T_LidApplyStation which extends the T_Station class. The base packml tries to return to IDLE.  By overriding the protected methods you can modify it's behavior.

This is not a full implementation of Packml as this does not utilize modes or any of the structures required, but is intended only as a simple example. 

There is also an initialize set of methods which is also outside of packml scope.
